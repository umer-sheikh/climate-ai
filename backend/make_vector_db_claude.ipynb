      "  \"answer\": \"In our organization, we utilize a standardized enterprise risk management (ERM) process to assess risks at the company level, which includes risks associated with climate change. Every business unit, region, and corporate function participates in this formal process to measure risks using standard evaluation criteria. Through this process, we typically identify 10-15 risks each year that are assigned ERM priorities to manage these risks under the supervision of the Senior Leadership Committee (SLC) and CEO. The EVP, EBS, and Sustainability, who is a member of the SLC, is responsible for climate-related issues. The SLC meets quarterly on major business issues, including Environment, Health, and Safety, with a subset focused on climate change. Our businesses address climate change issues relating to customer requirements, operational issues, such as new regulations and voluntary norms influenced by climate change, and supply chain issues. For example, the ERM process helped us endorse the new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and GHG standards, which mandates that vehicle fleets achieve an average of 54.5 mpg by 2025. We also support the US EPA phase two of the CAFE and GHG rule for commercial trucks. However, we have also identified the risk that the current Administration may reduce these mileage standards, which would not help mitigate climate change. Therefore, our organization's climate-related risk assessments consider various risks, including customer, operational, and supply chain issues associated with climate change.\"\n",
